## openClusterClaw

openClusterClaw is an enterprise-grade cluster orchestration and governance platform built for **OpenClaw at scale**. It transforms standalone OpenClaw instances into centrally managed, multi-tenant, production-ready infrastructure.

Designed for organizations operating large numbers of OpenClaw deployments, openClusterClaw provides unified control over the entire lifecycle of distributed instances—while abstracting infrastructure complexity from end users.

### Core Capabilities

* **Cluster-Scale Instance Management**
  Centralized provisioning, deployment, scaling, upgrade, and termination of OpenClaw instances.

* **Lifecycle Governance**
  Full lifecycle management from creation to decommissioning with policy enforcement and operational visibility.

* **Centralized Configuration Management**
  Multi-instance configuration standardization, version control, and controlled rollout across environments.

* **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
  Logical separation of tenants with governance controls, quota policies, and access management.

* **Unified Observability**
  Centralized monitoring of instance health, runtime status, and operational metrics across clusters.

### Value Proposition

openClusterClaw elevates OpenClaw from a distributed tool deployment model to an enterprise-managed service layer.

Enterprises manage:

* Underlying infrastructure and compute resources
* Configuration standards and governance policies
* Security, compliance, and operational control

End users receive:

* Turnkey OpenClaw access
* On-demand instance provisioning
* Simplified, self-service usage

In this model, **OpenClaw becomes infrastructure. OpenClaw becomes a service.**
